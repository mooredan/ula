Process Family Description
This non-silicided CMOS process has 3 metal layers and 2 poly layers,
and a high resistance layer. Stacked contacts are supported.
The process is for 5 volt applications. MOSIS orders EPI wafers for 
this process. Non-EPI (bulk) is an additional cost option and not 
available for MEP submissions. For further information, see the 
ON Semiconductor Foundry Mixed-Signal Offerings web page.

C5N Process
PiP (poly2 over poly) capacitors (950 aF/µm²) and the 
HRP (High Resistance) option are available on multiproject runs.

C5F Process
The C5F process offers the above layers of C5N plus 
Thick_Gate, N_Minus_Implant (Npblk), and P_Minus_Implant (Ppblk).


Design Rules
This process supports the following design rules.

Product Description
Optimized for 5 V mixed-signal applications, the C5 process family from 
ON Semiconductor offers a medium-density, high-performance mixed-signal 
technology capable of integrating complex analog functions, digital 
content and 20 V capability. This process delivers the advantages of a 
dedicated mixed-signal 0.5 µm process without the costs associated with 
the extra mask steps of a BCD process. Low-voltage transistors are also 
available for the 0.5 µm process making it well-suited for 
low-power applications.

Features
2 or 3 metal layers
Poly to poly capacitors
EEPROM
Schottky diodes
High voltage I/O – 12/20 V
High-resistance poly
Low-voltage modules

====================================================================
Projects submitted to MOSIS for fabrication can be designed using either 
layout design rules and layers specific to a process (vendor native rules) 
or (for some processes) vendor-independent, scalable rules (SCMOS rules). 
These rule sets cannot be mixed within a design.

The table below contains links to design kits, technology files, cell libraries, 
IP, and other design support for a variety of CAD tools for various processes 
available through MOSIS that use SCMOS rules.
