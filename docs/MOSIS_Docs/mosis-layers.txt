SCN3M and SCN3M_SUBM
MOSIS SCMOS Technology Codes and Layer Maps

This is the layer map for the technology codes SCN3M and SCN3M_SUBM 
using the MOSIS Scalable CMOS layout rules (SCMOS), and only for 
SCN3M and SCN3M_SUBM. For designs that are laid out using other 
design rules (or technology codes), use the standard layer mapping 
conventions of that design rule set. For submissions in GDS format, 
the datatype is "0" (zero) unless specified in the map below.

SCN3M_SUBM: Uses revised layout rules for better fit to sub-micron 
processes (see MOSIS Scalable CMOS (SCMOS) Design Rules, Section 2.4)

Fabricated on AMI 0.50 micron process runs.
